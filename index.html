    <h4>You can always count on me when...</h4>
    <p>Personally I think I'm a strong communicator and get along well with others.
        My technical knowledge is limited, but I feel like I can contribute by making every mistake in the book so others wont feel as bad about themselves. You're welcome!</p>
    <h4>Funny Story</h4>
    <p>I have a twin sister who is exactly the same age as me. (are you surprised yet?)
        We used to take the same classes when we were younger and admittedly I always tried to collaborate with my sister.
        She always refused because it wouldn't be genuine. Even when I tried to copy of her she would make sure I couldn't.
        Still on quite some tests the teacher would grill us because we made exactly the same mistakes.
        Little did she know we didn't copy off each other but just have this twin thing you know. She did not believe us.<br>
    Oh well...</p>

    <h4><strong>TL:DR</strong></h4>
    <p>Teacher thought my & my sister copied homework because we made exactly the same mistakes.</p>
